Hello! You can access the build for this assignment in the Builds.zip file, which contains a folder with the final build inside. Additionally, I included all necessary files from Unity, removing the Library and Logs folders. If you have any difficulty for some reason cloning these, let me know and I can get you another copy of the build somehow. My email is efleming@nevada.unr.edu. Thanks!
